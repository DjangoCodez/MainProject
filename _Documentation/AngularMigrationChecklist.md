# Angular Migration Checklist  

* **Ensure that the page uses correct DTO's for each returning api call: ItemDTO, ItemGridDTO, (ItemSmallDTO) etc.**  
    Implement any missing DTOs required according to our guidelines to keep data-in-transit as slim as possible.

* **Verify that correct api calls are made and that they reside in the new path (/v2)**  
    Also that the path-constant is used and generated by TypeWriter

* **When creating new controllers in the WebApi-project, make sure not having the same name as any other in this project (Not just within the v2 folder)**  
    Also make them rather small for a smaller scope.  

* **Verify that correct permission constants are used. Easy to miss when doing copy/paste of the code!**  
    ('Feature' enum collection)  

* **Check that all fields that are "required" really are set both in .html and in the form-class's field control definitions.**  

* **Check that all validation parameters are set correctly on the form-class's field control definitions.**  

* **Make sure to set maxLength on the form control according to what is defined for that field in db.**  
    (Do not trust how it was written in angularJS, always check the db anyway)  

* **Overriding loadData for custom loading or patching.**  
    If any custom loading or patching to the form is done, you can define your own loadData method declared as “override”.  

* **When migrating from a webforms edit page, a new Save-method should be created at server side.**  
    The previous Add- and Update-methods will then not be used in the migrated version.
