# Get a PAT from DevOps for the Agents

To set up the agents, you need to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) from Azure DevOps. Follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Personal Access Tokens**:
   - Click on icon next to your profile picture in the top right corner.
   - Click on **Personal access tokens**.

2. **Create a new PAT**:
   - Click on the **+ New Token** button.
   - Provide a name for the token (e.g., "Agent Setup Token").
   - Set the expiration date to **1 week**.
   - Select **Full access** for the scopes.

3. **Create the token**:
   - Click on the **Create** button.
   - Copy the generated token and store it securely. You will need this token to configure the agents.

Remember to keep the PAT secure and do not share it publicly.
